# M<sup>3</sup>-20M: Multi-Modal Molecular Dataset

Welcome to the official repository for M<sup>3</sup>-20M, the first large-scale Multi-Modal Molecular dataset, containing over 20 million molecules! üéâ

## Overview
M<sup>3</sup>-20M (Multi-Modal Molecular dataset) is designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery. It provides an unprecedented scale that highly benefits the training or fine-tuning of large models for superior performance in drug design and discovery tasks.

## Features
- **Scale**: Contains over 20 million molecules, 71 times more than the largest existing dataset.
- **Comprehensive Modalities**:
- One-dimensional SMILES strings
- Two-dimensional molecular graphs
- Three-dimensional molecular structures
- Physicochemical properties
- Text descriptions
- **Diverse Applications**: Supports various downstream tasks such as molecule generation, molecular property prediction, lead optimization, virtual screening, pharmacokinetics modeling, and drug-target interaction prediction.
